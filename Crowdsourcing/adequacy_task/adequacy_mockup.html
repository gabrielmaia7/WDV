                                    In this task, we want your help verifying how adequately some information is written. You will be asked to take a look
                                    at six pairs of information. Each pair consists of an English sentence and a triple formed by a subject, a predicate, and an object. Your goal is to
                                    identify whether the triple and the sentence convey the same information. To help you, whenever possible, we will provide you with descriptions and aliases (alternative names)
                                    for the subject, predicate, and object.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    For each pair, you will be asked to select between <b>Yes</b>, <b>No</b>, and <b>Not Sure</b> values, telling us if the pair communicates the same information.
                                    In case you select <b>No</b> or <b>Not Sure</b> we will ask you to select a reason from a predefined list.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    If your reason for selecting either No or Not Sure is <i>Other</i>, a little box will appear for you to tell us what it was.
                                    Please provide a simple but informative reason, as we are trying to improve this task in order to cost you and others less time to complete!

                                            We are not asking if the information is true. Even if the information is potentially or provably false, or goes against some common sense, please judge only if it is the same or different.

                                            Please <b>do not consider these</b> as a defect to the adequacy of the pair, unless it truly changes the information being communicated. If it makes the sentence impossible to understand, select <b>Not Sure</b>.

                                The triple is read as "Преображенский" -> date of birth -> 3 February 1939. Note that the subjects seem to be the same, even if not written in English, and even if <b>ж</b> was replaced by <b>??</b>, so that is <b>not</b> a reason for inadequacy. However, there seems to be conflicting information, with the sentence pointing to 1950 but the triple to 1939, so we can select <b>No</b> because of it. A fitting reason would be <i>The object of the triple and the object of the sentence are different entities or values.</i>

                                The triple is read as Stilleven met likeurfles -> genre -> still life. Here, both the sentence and the triple seem to suggest that the genre of Stilleven met likeurfles is still life. However, there is additional information on the sentence that conflicts with details of the triple; the sentence claims that Stilleven met likeurfles is a photography, while the subject's description claims it is a painting , so we can select <b>No</b>. A fitting reason would be <i> The sentence introduces additional information that conflicts with descriptions given with the triple.</i>
